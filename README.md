# Sovol-SV06-ACE-presets

My Sovol SV06 ACE printer and filament presets backup.

Currently using a Sovol SV06 ACE (2025) with no mod.

Most of the PLA are printing almost perfectly so, I only changed:

- Calibration of extrusion : https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/extruder_calibration.html
- xy_contour_compensation set to 0.1

Currently, the real tweaking needed is for the TPU, I currently only have ColorFabb - VarioShore.
